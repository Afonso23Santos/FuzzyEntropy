# FuzzyEntropy
Finding the optimal threshold for noise signal distinction using Fuzzy Entropy algorithms

Entropy algorithms are a valuable tool in analyzing dynamic signals, particularly biomedical signals, which tend to be non-stationary and subject to random fluctuations. Fuzzy entropy was introduced to answer specific limitations in previous algorithms, by employing fuzzy membership functions, which conveycontinuity to this particular computation. This
work aims to reproduce and extend previous research using a Fuzzy Entropy algorithm by confirming specific results and evaluating the optimization of a MF-specific threshold.

"Fuz.m" is a function that outputs the fuzzy entropy measurement.
"plots.m" and "optimal.m" output the results present in the report.
Run "Programa.m" to easily compute the entropy value under user-defined parameters.
